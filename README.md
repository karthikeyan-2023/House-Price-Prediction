# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A simple machine learning project that predicts house prices based on different property features.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction inside a Jupyter/Colab notebook.

## 📌 Features
- Loads housing dataset  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning model training  
- Model evaluation (R², MAE, MSE, RMSE)  
- Predicts house prices using trained model
